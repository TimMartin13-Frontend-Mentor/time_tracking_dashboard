## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript


### What I learned

I am learning about how to breakdown my scss into smaller files to make them easier to read. That way the main.scss has almost nothing in it.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
// Abstracts
@import "./abstracts/__abstracts-dir";
// Base Styles
@import "./base/__base-dir";
// Card layout
@import "./layout/__layout-dir";
// Components
@import "./components/__components-dir";


body {
  background-color: black;
}
```

### Continued development

I am going to continue to focus on breaking up my css into smaller, workable files while I move on to refreshing my skills in JavaScript and React.


### Useful resources

- [Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - I use this for every project
- [SCSS Architecture](https://matthewelsom.com/blog/simple-scss-playbook.html) - I found this to be the resource that I used the most when breaking up my SCSS
